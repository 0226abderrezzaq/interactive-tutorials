Arguments can be passed to the script when it is executed, by writing them as a space-delimited list following the script file name.

	./bin/my_shopping.sh apple 5 banana 8 "Fruit Basket" 15

Inside the script, the $1 variable references the first argument in the command line, $2 the second argument and so forth.
The variable $0 references to the current script 

	echo $3			       # banana
	BIG=$5
	echo "A $BIG costs just $6"    # A Fruit Basket costs just 15

The variable $# holds the number of arguments passed to the script

	echo $#			       # 6

The variable $@ holds a space delimited string of all arguments passed to the script
