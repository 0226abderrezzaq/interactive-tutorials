Tutorial
--------

Web developers have been choosing Twitter Bootstrap as the leading framework for desining UI. As you might have
noticed, the default HTML styles are not appealing as the websites we see around every day. The Bootstrap framework
allows us to write plain HTML that looks much more modern and useful than the default HTML stylesheet.

To load Bootstrap, we would need to load it from somewhere. We can load the Bootstrap library from a CDN by running
the following `<link>` tag:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
