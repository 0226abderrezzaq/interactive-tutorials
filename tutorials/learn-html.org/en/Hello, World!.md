Welcome to *Learn HTML*, the easiest way to learn HTML & CSS online, interactively.

Learning HTML & CSS is essential for any web developer, and does not require to know how to program using JavaScript. 

Over the years, many CSS & JavaScript libraries have been introduced. The CSS libraries ease the process of creating a 
beautiful website with little effort, and requires only very basic CSS knowledge to use. Since mastering CSS is a very
hard task, the libraries enabled millions of developers to start creating websites easily, without previous knowledge
in designing websites at all.

Here are a few examples of CSS libraries that were recently introduced and are ranking high on Google:

* Bootstrap, by Twitter
* Foundation, by Zurb
* Pure CSS, by Yahoo
* Bulma (based on the new CSS3 Flexbox specification)

In this tutorial, we will be using Bootstrap, the most common CSS library out there, but the basic concept of a CSS 
library is pretty much the same - it is based on the "grid system", which is an easy way to define the layout of an 
HTML page that was developed over the years.

Let's start by creating a simple HTML page. An HTML page has the following basic layout:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            ... head definitions go here ...
        </head>
        <body>
            ... the content goes here ...
        </body>
    </html>

Let's start by creating a simple page that contains the phrase "Hello, World!" in the body. The page will also have 
a title - that thing that shows up in the title of the tab in your browser.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Hello, World!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Hello, World!</p>
        </body>
    </html>
