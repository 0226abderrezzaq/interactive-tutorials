### Data types

C++ has several types of variables, but there are a few basic types:

### Defining variables

To define the variables `foo` and `bar`, we need to use the following syntax:

    int foo;
    int bar = 1;


Exercise
--------

In the next exercise, you will need to create a program which prints out the sum of the numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Tutorial Code
-------------

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
      return 0;
    }

Expected Output
---------------
    The sum of a, b, and c is 12.750000.

Solution
--------
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {

      /* Your code goes here */

      printf("The sum of a, b, and c is %f.", sum);
      return 0;
    }
