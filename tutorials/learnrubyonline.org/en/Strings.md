Tutorial
--------
Strings are anything between "" or ''. It makes no difference if you use single quotes or double quotes. For example,
    myFirstString = 'I am a string!' #single quotes
    mySecondString = "Me too!" #double quotes
There are many things you can do with strings, using methods.
.length will give you the number of characters in a string.
    "Hi!".length #is 3
.reverse will flip the string around.
    "Hi!".reverse #is !iH
.upcase will make a string all caps.
    "Hi!".upcase #is HI!
and .downcase will make a string all lowercase.
    "Hi!".downcase #is hi!
There are many more methods, but I am not going to list them all.
