# Multi-dimensional Arrays

In the previous tutorials of [Arrays](https://www.learn-c.org/en/Arrays), we covered, well, arrays and how they work. But C can do another type of arrays; Mulitdimensional Arrays. Here is the general form of a multidimensional array declaration -

```c
type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];
```

For example, here's a basic one for you to look at -

```c
int foo[1][2][3];
```

or maybe this one -

```c
char vowels[1][5] = {
    {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
}
```

## Two-dimensional Arrays

The simplest form of multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is pretty much a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size [ x ][ y ], you would write something like this −

```c
int arrayName [ x ][ y ];
```

Where __type__ can be any C data type (int, char, long, long long, double, etc.) and __arrayName__ will be a valid C identifier, or variable. A two-dimensional array can be considered as a table which will have [x] number of rows and [y] number of columns. A two-dimensional array a, which contains three rows and four columns can be shown and thought about like this −

![Table 1A](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/images/two_dimensional_arrays.jpg)

In this sense, every element in the array a is identified by an element name of the form __a[ i ][ j ]__, where 'a' is the name of the array, and 'i' and 'j' are the indexes that uniquely identify, or show, each element in 'a'.

And honestly, you really don't have to put in a [x] value really, because if you did something like this -

```c
char vowels[][5] = {
    {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}
    {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
}
```

the compiler would already know that there is two "dimensions" you could say (you would really want to do this if you were tricking a manager at a job interview you know what you're doing in C (I do not advise you to do that though ;P)), but you need need __NEED__ a [y] value!! The compiler may be smart, but it _will not know_ how many integers, characters, floats, whatever you're using you have in the dimensions. Keep that in mind.

## Initializing Two-Dimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays may be used by specifying bracketed[] values for each row. Below is an array with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns.

```cpp
int a[3][4] = {  
   {0, 1, 2, 3} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 0 */
   {4, 5, 6, 7} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 1 */
   {8, 9, 10, 11}   /*  initializers for row indexed by 2 */
};
```
